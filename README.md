<p>Welcome to my page! </br> My name is Hanyu, but you may find it more convenient to call me Shane. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics at the University of Massachusetts 
  Amherst. As I near the completion of my graduate studies, I have begun to actively prepare for my next academic challenge: applying for a Ph.D. program in my field. My goal is to continue to deepen my 
  understanding and contribute to the field of statistics through advanced research.
